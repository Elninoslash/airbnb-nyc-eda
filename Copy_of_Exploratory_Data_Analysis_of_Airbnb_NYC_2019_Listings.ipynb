The dataset contains approximately 48,895 records with a mix of numerical and categorical variables related to listings, hosts, pricing, and demand.\n",

        "The analysis began with understanding the dataset structure, identifying missing values, checking for duplicate records, and performing basic data wrangling. Irrelevant columns with missing values were removed, missing review frequency values were handled logically, duplicate records were checked, and unrealistic price values were filtered to ensure data quality. These preprocessing steps ensured that the dataset was clean, consistent, and suitable for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Univariate analysis was used to study individual variables such as price, availability, room type, and minimum nights. This revealed that most listings fall within the budget to mid-range price segment and that short-term stays dominate the platform. Bivariate analysis helped examine relationships between variables such as price vs room type, price vs reviews, and availability vs demand, highlighting how pricing and location influence customer engagement. Multivariate analysis further combined multiple variables to provide deeper insights into how price, room type, and location jointly impact demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "A total of 20 meaningful visualizations were created to support the analysis. Each chart was selected carefully based on the type of variables involved and the business question being addressed. Insights from the analysis provide actionable recommendations for pricing optimization, availability management, and targeted marketing strategies. Overall, this project demonstrates how EDA can convert raw data into valuable business insights for data-driven decision-making."

The challenge is to analyze this data to identify pricing patterns, availability trends, and demand drivers while addressing data quality issues such as missing values and outliers.

The analysis revealed that Airbnb listings are predominantly budget to mid-range priced, with a smaller segment of premium listings. Pricing is strongly influenced by room type and location, with entire homes and listings in Manhattan commanding higher prices. Customer engagement, measured through reviews and review frequency, tends to be higher for competitively priced listings, highlighting the importance of affordable pricing strategies.\n",

        "The study also showed that availability alone does not guarantee higher demand, emphasizing that factors such as price, room type, and perceived value play a more significant role in attracting bookings. Multivariate analysis confirmed that no single variable drives demand or pricing, reinforcing the need for a multi-factor decision-making approach. These insights can help Airbnb and hosts optimize pricing, improve availability planning, and design targeted marketing strategies.\n",

        "However, the analysis also highlighted certain drawbacks. A large number of listings have low review counts, which can negatively impact trust and visibility on the platform.

Additionally, limited availability in high-demand areas restricts revenue potential, while strict minimum night requirements may discourage short-term travelers.\n",
